# Rails blogger

Deployed live on [AWS EB](http://zeller-rails-blogger.us-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)
 // [Heroku](https://cryptic-hollows-52698.herokuapp.com/)


This is a simple blogger made from scratch using Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap.

It has basic user authentification, allows for basic creation of articles, tagging articles, uploading images, editing and deleting articles.

I learned a lot of Rails functionality including:
* Models, views, and controllers (MVC)
* Data structures and relationships
* Routing
* db migrations
* Views with forms, partials, and helpers
* Restful design

As well as:
* Setting up AWS S3 and ElasticBeanstalk
* Implementing Bootstrap on a site
